# Keypad_Calculator
This Project consists of a Keypad and a Quad 7 seven segment display connected to an Arduino Mega Microcontroller. The user can input two positive integers upto 4 digits and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. The final result alone is displayed on the Quad seven segment display. For subtraction, negative result is also displayed. If the result is greater than four digits or if the result is a four digit negative number, an error message (EEEE) is displayed. 
Even though Arduino is used for this project, Arduino libraries and built in functions are not used for Programming. Instead, Bare Metal Programming is used for this project.
